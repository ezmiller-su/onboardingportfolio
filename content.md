## Unsolicited Recommendation Letter

## Smoking Memorandum

### Original Memo
Thereby notify you that beginning in two months, Fitness Exercise Equipment, Inc. will institute a new policy concerning employee contributions to the cost of their health care insurance. Employees who smoke will pay 15% more than those who don't.
The delay between this announcement and the beginning date for this new policy will allow any employees who smoke the chance to enroll in courses which, I hope, will help them break or curtail their habit. In accordance with my concern for the wellness of all employees, this will encourage all employees to stop smoking.

### Memo Objectives
- Clearly state the change in policy.
- Be transparent about your motivation.
- Persuade employees to quit smoking for their own sake, not solely for their job.

### Strategies to Increase Effectiveness
- Frame the disparate divergent fees as a discount and reward.
- Explain how the company benefits.
- Accentuate the benefits of quitting smoking.
- Avoid focus on expenses.

### Revised Memo

Fitness Exercise Equipment, Inc. is changing policy regarding employee’s health care insurance contributions. After last year’s ban on smoking on company property, we are taking further action to improve wellness of all employees. 
We would like to reward and incentivize employees who do not smoke will receive a 15% discount in their health care. Effective in two months’ time, we encourage employees who smoke to enroll in courses to break their habit.
