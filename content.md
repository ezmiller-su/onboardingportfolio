## Rhetorical Analysis of NPR
National Public Radio (NPR) effectively outlines their organization's mission/culture on their [about page](https://www.npr.org/about/).

Stylistically, NPR's bio is written formally with factual claims and a focus on achievement and scale of their work. NPR illustrates their commitment in public service and their reliance on collaboration and donations. NPR establishes their role as a news source by appealing to ethos. They cite their outreach in terms of quantity, for example, the "millions of Americans" they connect with daily. Furthermore, they differentiate themselves from competition using logos: "Approximately 99% of the U.S. population [...] within the broadcast listening area", which no other news organization has.

## WRT305 Application

### Letter
Lyndsey Weiner, Professor <br>
Writing Department <br>
Syracuse University <br>
Syracuse, New York 13210 <br>

Dear Professor Weiner,

I am writing to express my interest in enrolling as a service-learner in your section of WRT 307. Currently, I am a senior in the School of Information Studies, majoring in Applied Data Analytics. While I am required to take WRT307, I am particularly interested in the service-learning section. My best work is produced when there is a substantial purpose to it.

Although I have gained extensive experience in writing through previous writing courses at university (WRT105/205), I attribute most of my skill to growing up with an English Literature teacher for a father. 

I anticipate that your class will not only augment my ability to communicate clearly and concisely in a professional setting on paper, but also verbally as we work with our agency. These skills will serve me invaluably for the duration of my career.

Sincerely,<br>
Ezra J Miller

## Unsolicited Recommendation Letter

RE: Proposal for Psychology and Data Analytics Collaborative Program
 
Dear Dean Hemsley,
 
I am writing to request your guidance concerning the opportunity to strengthen interdisciplinary collaboration between the School of Information Studies and the Department of Psychology to better prepare students for emerging careers at the scientific intersection of behavior and data.

I am aware of the efforts that you and the iSchool have undertaken in terms of creating collaborative curricula between distinct colleges. The dual enrollment programs established with the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications and Martin J. Whitman School of Management, respectively, provide great opportunities for students interested in both subjects. Additionally, your personal background in both industry and academia indicates that you may see the value in finding a practical solution to educational gaps.

My concern is that the current separation between programs disengages students from developing integrated skillsets. Psychology students learn rigorous research methods but lack computational tools for large-scale data analysis and gaining insight. Data science students, on the other hand, develop technical skills but often miss the context that makes insights meaningful. Both groups’ education is diminished significantly from this disparity.

I am proposing the development of collaborative opportunities between each program through formalized partnerships. Until comprehensive curricular reformations can occur, we must facilitate cross-disciplinary learning. This approach could include a joint "Behavioral Data Science" elective course, combining both skillsets, psychological studies requiring data analytics pipelines, visualization, and guest lectures exchanging expertise between departments. These initiatives would greatly augment students’ experiences and increase allure for prospective employers.

Thank you sincerely for your time in reading this letter, and for your consideration of my concerns and proposal. As a student pursuing both Applied Data Analytics and Psychology degrees, It would be an honor to assist in developing a new program or simply sharing my perspective as a double major.
 
Respectfully yours,

Ezra J Miller<br>

## Smoking Memorandum

### Original Memo
To: All Employees<br>
From: C. K. Mitchell<br>
Subject: Smoke-Free Environment

Thereby notify you that beginning in two months, Fitness Exercise Equipment, Inc. will institute a new policy concerning employee contributions to the cost of their health care insurance. Employees who smoke will pay 15% more than those who don't.

The delay between this announcement and the beginning date for this new policy will allow any employees who smoke the chance to enroll in courses which, I hope, will help them break or curtail their habit. In accordance with my concern for the wellness of all employees, this will encourage all employees to stop smoking.

### Revised Memo
To: All Employees<br>
From: C. K. Mitchell<br>
Subject: Changes to Health Care Plan in Regards to our Smoking Policy

Fitness Exercise Equipment, Inc. is changing policy regarding employee’s health care insurance contributions. Health care costs have risen substantially again this year, despite last year’s ban on smoking on company property, which has forced our hand in increasing employees’ health care expenses.

I understand that this may feel unfair to those who have co-operated in our efforts to improve wellness of all employees. To further reward and incentivize employees who do not smoke, we are offering a 15% discount in health care. I would like to clarify that recreational cannabis is not exempt, despite its legal status in New York State. The impact on our insurance costs is no different.

In the two months before the new policy goes into effect, we encourage employees who smoke to prioritize their health above all. HR will gladly assist you with scheduling conflicts if you choose to enroll in quitting courses to break the habit.

### Memo Objectives
- Clearly state the change in policy.
- Be transparent about your motivation.
- Persuade employees to quit smoking for their own sake, not solely for their job.

### Strategies to Increase Effectiveness
- Frame the disparate divergent fees as a discount and reward.
- Explain how the company benefits.
- Accentuate the benefits of quitting smoking.
- Avoid focus on expenses.
